## Approach
This app is a simple store that allows anyone to create a product as well as edit and destroy.
All products are listed on the /products path. This site is project to implement the ZURB Foundation framework.

The first problem ran into was installation of the gem. The current release of the foundation gem is unstable and thus I had to use the 5.4.3.0 gem.
This was a follow along from the screencast found at http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation
